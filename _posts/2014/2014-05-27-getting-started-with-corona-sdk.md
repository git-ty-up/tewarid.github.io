This post has links and references for getting started with Corona SDK on a Mac, and running your apps on an iOS device.

[Download](https://developer.coronalabs.com/downloads/corona-sdk) and [install](http://docs.coronalabs.com/guide/start/installMac/index.html) Corona SDK. You'll need a free starter or a paid account at coronalabs.com to activate the SDK.

You can [write](http://docs.coronalabs.com/guide/start/helloWorld/index.html) your own app in [Lua](http://docs.coronalabs.com/guide/start/introLua/index.html), or execute sample applications using Corona Simulator application. Corona SDK has several [libraries](http://docs.coronalabs.com/api/library/index.html) at your disposal. I am particularly interested in [UI](http://docs.coronalabs.com/api/library/widget/index.html) development, and [bridging](http://docs.coronalabs.com/native/ios/index.html) Lua and C to access external hardware such as Bluetooth LE peripherals. That ability to build native extensions requires a paid enterprise license.

You can [build and deploy](http://docs.coronalabs.com/guide/distribution/iOSBuild/index.html) the app to an iOS device for further testing. The build process happens online and requires an internet connection.
