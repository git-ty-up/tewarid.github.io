# Getting Started with Bluetooth Low Energy by Kevin Townsend et al; O'Reilly Media

![Getting Started with Bluetooth Low Energy, Tools and Techniques for Low-Power Networking](http://akamaicovers.oreilly.com/images/0636920033011/lrg.jpg)

Bluetooth LE, or Bluetooth Smart as it is officially known, has generated a lot of interest for all the good reasons. [Getting Started with Bluetooth Low Energy](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033011.do) by Kevin Townsend et al is a solid guide to the topic, along with other good books such as [Bluetooth Low Energy: The Developer's Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Low-Energy-Developers-Handbook-ebook/dp/B009XDA1G8).

The book begins by discussing the key characteristics, limitations, and use cases of Bluetooth LE technology, in chapter 1\. The following four chapters take a deep dive into the protocols that comprise Bluetooth LE, beginning with an overview in Chapter 2\. Chapter 3 delves into the Generic Attribute Profile or GAP (advertising and connections). Chapter 4 delves into Generic Attribute Profile or GATT (services and characteristics).

Makers need to select hardware to leverage Bluetooth LE. It may come in the form of a module that you program to act as a peripheral, or a USB dongle that you may plug into a USB host. Chapter 5 discusses several such options. Chapters 6 and 7 delve into debugging and design tools that aid developers during development and troubleshooting.

Chapter 8 shows how to leverage Bluetooth LE on Android using the Bluetooth Application Accelerator library from the Bluetooth SIG. You'll learn how to establish connection and communicate with a remote device. Chapter 9 delves into Bluetooth LE programming on iOS by demonstrating several practical applications.

Chapter 10, the concluding chapter, shows how to leverage Bluetooth LE on embedded devices. It uses a hardware module introduced in chapter 5, in conjunction with ARM's mbed platform, to build a peripheral that can be used with Android and iOS devices.

All source code shown in the book can be forked from the author's GitHub [repo](https://github.com/microbuilder/IntroToBLE). The text has occasional spelling mistakes that don't affect readability.

I'd like to thank O'Reilly Media for providing an e-book to review.
