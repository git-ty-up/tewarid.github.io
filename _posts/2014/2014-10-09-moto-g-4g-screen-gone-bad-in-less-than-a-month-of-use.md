Besides the line artifacts that appear on the screen, the image seems to be at a lower resolution. Icons and fonts appear more pixelated. Pressing on the screen below the camera causes the artifacts to move. To ensure it was the display and not the software, I took the screenshot below

I bought it on one of my U.S. trips. The local authorized service center will only service under warranty Moto Gs bought in Brazil. I didn't even save any money buying it in the U.S., it costs about the same in Brazil. Note to self, buy Apple products on international trips, they've got an international warranty program.
