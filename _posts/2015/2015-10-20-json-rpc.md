# JSON-RPC

If your HTML5 application requires RPC (remote procedure call) semantics, [JSON-RPC](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) is an easy specification to implement.

The implementation below allows sending requests and receiving responses, and leverages JQuery's custom events to raise notifications (requests sent by server without an id). You'll need to implement the `send` function, to send the RPC message to the server. A corresponding receive function should call `dispatchMessage` to handle a RPC message received from the server.

{% gist 3afb467cdddd2108e7e7972b94c1329e %}

The following code snippet demonstrates how to handle a notification called `foo`, sent by a server

```javascript
$(document).on("foo", function (e, request) {
    // do something with request.data
});
```

The following code snippet demonstrates how to send a new request for a method called `bar`, and handle the corresponding response

```javascript
// data is some object that will be stringified
var request = new Request("bar", data);
request.execute(function (response) {
    // do something with response.error or response.result
})
```

I'll leave the server-side code to handle JSON-RPC as an exercise to the reader. I've intentionally modified the `params` attribute in JSON-RPC spec to `data`, because the former is a [reserved keyword in C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/). Using reserved keywords with [dynamic programming capabilities of libraries such as JSON.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/CreateJsonDynamic.htm) causes compilation errors.
