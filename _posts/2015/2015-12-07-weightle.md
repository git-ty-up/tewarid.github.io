<span style="color:#8a23cf;">WeightLE</span> (\ˈwāt-lē\) is a concept Bluetooth Smart utility, not unlike a beverage coaster or beermat, that learns from the weight placed over it, and notifies you when it's too low. You get to decide what low means.

It can be used with bottles, cups, jars, and even water coolers. Anything that isn't smart yet can be made smarter, so you are not left without that something when you need it the most. An accompanying Smartphone or Smartwatch app is required with WeightLE.
