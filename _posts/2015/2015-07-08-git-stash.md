git stash can be a useful mechanism to set aside work you're not ready to commit yet.

To stash staged changes simply run

```bash
git stash
```

Files in working directory not added to index are not affected, unless you add the -u option to stash those as well.

To view a list of stashes

```bash
git stash list
```

To inspect details of latest stash

```bash
git stash show stash@{0}
```

0 is the id shown by stash list. Use of `stash@{0}` is optional for latest stash entry.

To apply changes in latest stash to working directory

```bash
git stash apply
```

To eliminate the latest stash (use pop to apply **and** drop)

```bash
git stash drop
```

If stash apply or pop fails due to conflicts, but you still want to stage the changes, try

```bash
git checkout stash -- .
```

`--` indicates current branch. The single dot indicates path beginning at current directory, but may be several different path specs. stash may be replaced with `stash@{0}`, use a different id to work with older stashes.
