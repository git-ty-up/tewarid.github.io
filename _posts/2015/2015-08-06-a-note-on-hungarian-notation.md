Back in the old days of Visual Basic, I got into the habit of using the [Hungarian notation](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/rick_schaut/2004/02/14/hungarian-notation/). That habit stuck with me through the Java days, but I've kicked it off almost completely now. My conclusion is that variable names should be clear, free of obscure prefixes, and explain their purpose. If I want to know the scope or type of the variable, I'll just look it up using an IDE or grep.

Please read the post I've linked to above, to understand that there are at least two kinds of Hungarian notation. One comes from [Charles Simonyi](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa260976.aspx), the other popularized by [Charles Petzold](http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2006/05/040939.html).
