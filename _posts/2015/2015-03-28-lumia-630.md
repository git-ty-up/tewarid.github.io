# Lumia 630

A couple of years back I never thought I'd be buying a Windows phone, but I have used Windows  Mobile quite extensively in the past. At R$ 320 (approximately US$ 104) I found a Lumia 630 to be a decent upgrade for my wife, after a LG L40 she'd been using.

Here's what I like about it:

* 4.5 inch screen with good viewing angles and blacks.
* Nice sturdy plastic body.
* Replaceable 1830 mAh battery. The phone lasts almost two days on a charge without heavy use.
* Dual Sim.
* Quad-core Snapdragon 430 with sensor core technology for activity tracking.
* 5 megapixel back camera with autofocus.
* Digital TV.
* It'll get a free update to Windows 10 for phones.

Here's what could be better:

* It has 512 MB of RAM. The kinds of apps my wife uses hardly demand any more.
* No camera flash. The situations where that would help are very few. It does make a handy flashlight though.
* No screen brightness adjustment based on ambient light.
* Mail app does not support push notification, and GMail specific features. My wife ended up trading the phone for my daughter's Moto E.
* Poor app ecosystem means you end up having to use the browser a lot more often.
