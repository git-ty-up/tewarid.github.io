Windows 10 Technical Preview looks fresh and awesome. As someone who has adopted Windows 8 right since it was launched, Windows 10 helps reduce friction like Windows 8 never did. Here's what I like about it

* Start menu - Yes, it is back!
* Windows - All apps are Windows apps again. No more old vs new, you'll probably never know which app is _new_.

Here's a short wish list for what I hope Microsoft will do with it

* Reduce the number of variants to just two, Enterprise and non-Enterprise.
* Provide friction-less and free or low-cost upgrade from Windows 8.1, and then allow restoring the computer to Windows 10 without needing to install Windows 7, upgrade to Windows 8, 8.1, and 10. I build and upgrade my computers for years before buying a new one.
