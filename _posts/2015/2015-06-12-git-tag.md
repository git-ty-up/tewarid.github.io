# git tag

This post summarizes some useful tag related commands. All commands assume a tag with value v1.0.0, a [version number](http://semver.org/). To create an annotated tag

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "a comment"
```

To list all tags

```bash
git tag
```

To view details and diff for a tag

```bash
git show v1.0.0
```

To delete a tag

```bash
git tag -d v1.0.0
```

To replace a tag when it already exists

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -f -m "a comment"
```

To create a tag pointing to the same commit as another tag

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 v1.0.0-rc -m "a comment"
```

To create a tag pointing to a specific commit

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 commit -m "a comment"
```

To checkout working tree at tag (add option -b to create branch at that point in the tree)

```bash
git checkout v1.0.0
```

To view commit log with tags

```bash
git log --decorate=full
```

To push tags to origin (add -f to force update if tag exists on remote)

```bash
git push origin --tags
```

To push tag deletes to origin

```bash
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0
```

For other commands and options use `man git` or `man git-tag`.
