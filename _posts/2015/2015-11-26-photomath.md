# PhotoMath

PhotoMath, by MicroBlink Ltd., is a neat little utility available from the [iOS App Store](https://appsto.re/us/UPcY2.i), and [Android Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microblink.photomath), that can make solving elementary Math homework less of a chore. Besides giving the answer outright, it provides a detailed step-by-step procedure for arriving at the answer.

Try it while the following equation is displayed on a second screen

$$
2x^2+3=11
$$

It does have its limitations though. An equation such as the following is currently unsolvable

$$
\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{x}}}}=3
$$

[Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/) makes short work of that equation when you [query](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B1-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B1%2B%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B1-%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7Bx%7D%7D%7D%7D%3D3) it using its $$\LaTeX$$ representation.
