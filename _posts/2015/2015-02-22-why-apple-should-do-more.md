Apple is a phenomenally successful company. It does not behoove it to be stingy in fixing inherent problems in its devices. Why did it take so long and a class action suite to instate the [MacBook Pro Repair Extension Program for Video Issues](http://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/)? This is not the only instance where they've actually messed up but not fessed up.

I've been sitting on an [iPhone 4S with a Wi-Fi issue](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5984942), apparently caused by a flawed chip that cannot handle enough heat. That problem appeared after two years of use, but many have encountered it right after unboxing. I didn't actually contact Apple, but others who did have been offered not so cheap replacement options.

Apple being Apple, shouldn't be stingy about fixing its problems. I haven't purchased an iPhone from Apple since I encountered the Wi-Fi issue. I'd rather purchase a cheap Android phone than an expensive iPhone that cannot last two years without exhibiting a serious issue.
