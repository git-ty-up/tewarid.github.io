![Full Moon on new year night 2010](/assets/img/moon.jpg)

This is a snap of the moon I took on new year's eve, with a slightly advanced point-and-shoot at 12x optical zoom, 10MP resolution, and without a tripod. I played around with the manual settings a bit. For those in the market for a point-and-shoot, and don't mind a slightly bulkier camera, I recommend the [Fuji s1500](http://www.amazon.com/Fujifilm-FinePix-Digital-Stabilized-Optical/dp/B001QENO7A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1259076706&sr=8-1).
