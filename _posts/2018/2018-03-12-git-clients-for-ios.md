# Git clients for iOS

I've tried the following Git clients on iOS, to edit this Jekyll blog on the go. I settled on Git2Go because you can push to public GitHub repositories with the free app.

- [Clone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clone-advanced-mobile-client/id1037881290?mt=8)

- [Git2Go](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/git2go-git-client-you-always/id963577401?mt=8) (currently unavailable)

- [TIG](https://itunes.apple.com/br/app/tig-git-client/id1161732225?mt=8)

- [Working Copy](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy/id896694807?mt=8)
