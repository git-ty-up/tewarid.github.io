![Screenshot of my first Windows 10 IoT Core Xamarin Forms application running on a Raspberry Pi 3](/assets/img/xamarin-forms-uwp.jpg)

The app is the first exercise in [Udemy's Xamarin Forms course](https://www.udemy.com/xamarin-forms-course). The UWP build targeting Windows IoT Core was created following [Adding a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) App](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/platform-features/windows/installation/universal/). Take a look at how other native [UWP IoT Core samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-iotcore-samples) look and work. Also take a look at [Xamarin Forms sample apps](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-forms-samples) available at GitHub. You can also create an OS X application following [Bringing macOS to Xamarin.Forms](https://blog.xamarin.com/preview-bringing-macos-to-xamarin-forms/).
