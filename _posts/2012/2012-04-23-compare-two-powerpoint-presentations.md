PowerPoint 2010 does have a [compare feature](http://www.addictivetips.com/microsoft-office/powerpoint-2010-compare-two-presentations/), as did 2003. You can't do it with Microsoft PowerPoint 2007. You can however publish the presentations as Word documents (including annotations) and compare those. It is a bit of a hassle but better than nothing.
