If you have a scratched EA game media, you can use the serial number to download the game from Origin. You'll need to download and install [Origin](http://www.origin.com/download). When done, run the Origin client. From the Origin menu select "Redeem Product Code...". Provide the serial number that accompanies the media, and your game should be available for download. Pretty useful!
