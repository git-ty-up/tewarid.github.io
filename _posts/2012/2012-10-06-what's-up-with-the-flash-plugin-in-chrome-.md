# What's up with the Flash plugin in Chrome?

![Flash Plugin](/assets/img/chrome-flash-plugin.gif)

I have been having some persistent issues with the Flash plugin in Chrome.

Here's a list in no particular order

* A site dependent on Flash will not load properly.

* A video on YouTube will play with stuttering video and audio.

* Unable to sign in at Apple https://www.icloud.com because the keyboard slows down to a crawl.

I mention the iCloud problem because that is one site that probably doesn't use Flash content.

I have to repeatedly go to chrome://plugins/ in Chrome to disable the Flash plugin, then enable it again to watch a buggy YouTube video that will play only after I have watched an Ad. Tiresome!

Adobe and Google should decide what they want to do with the Flash plugin. Make it stable or pull the plug. YouTube shouldn't be requiring the use of Flash either.
