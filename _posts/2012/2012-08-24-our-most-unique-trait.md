All that science does is explain that which exists. All that is will not suddenly become different because of our understanding of it. What makes science interesting is that in understanding our universe we create.

If we are to quietly accept the scriptures, or become servants of existing knowledge, we cease to create. We cease to be useful to the universe. Our most fruitful purpose in existing is creation. It happens through our biological procreation, music, dance, art, prose, technology, and whatever else that makes our lives meaningful, including our religious rituals and ceremonies.

We are fighting for survival, even if it may not seem so at first. The odds are always stacked against us. We don't know why we exist. Our existence, and our knowledge of the fact that we exist, is a conundrum that we stare at from the moment early childhood leaves us, and we begin to take our first bumbling steps towards adulthood.

In death we see a cruel certainty. We strive to do all that we may to live the most extraordinary experiences before we die. I have found this desire strange because that matters nought after we're dead. Then I remember that this desire to explore, have new experiences, set off towards the unknown, are means to liberate our creative spirits.

We have made use of our scientific knowledge for creature comfort. A good majority of us have become complacent, dull. It is time to jolt ourselves out of our comfort zones. We have to ask hard questions and create sustainable innovation. The study of evolution has shown us that very long periods of time pass before a dominant species is subjected to any stress. In a very brief period after that, it goes extinct. We have been subjecting countless species to that end.

It may just be that by eliminating every last biological enemy our survival will be ensured. We may arrive at grand, technological landscapes, that we conjure in our books and movies. These visions have made our lives more meaningful. There is however our biology to contend with, still very deeply entwined with nature.

We have created vast tracts of plantations, but we are far from converting sunlight to food. Our species still lives in hungry misery. Our most useful medication is inspired by the very species that are going extinct. We don't understand our biology enough, or possess the necessary technology to make medicine from the known elements.

We have to liberate our creativity from the shackles of ignorance. We are collectively at fault. Let this be a manifesto and call for action.
