I've temporarily disabled the like button for posts. I was getting likes from people I suspect weren't that interested in the post itself but rather in furthering their agenda (as in spamming me). I'll bring the like button back when WordPress gives me the capability to delete such likes. Since most of my readers arrive from Google Search, I think the typical anonymous user will find it much easier to just rate a post. I want to simplify rating the posts by adopting the Nero (up/down) rating scheme, but the dashboard has no statistics for that.
