![GitHub Client for Windows](https://s3.amazonaws.com/github-images/blog/2012/gh4w/dashboard.PNG)

The new GitHub [client](https://desktop.github.com) for Windows is simply awesome! They say it also works with other git repositories. I used it over the weekend and I have to admit I am not going back to the command line, except maybe in some rare situations. I am happy they are making good use of those [VC investments](https://www.cnet.com/news/github-raises-100-million-from-andreessen-horowitz/).
