![GitHub Client for Windows](/assets/img/git-windows-github-client.png)

The new GitHub [client](http://windows.github.com/) for Windows is simply awesome! They say it also works with other git repositories. I used it over the weekend and I have to admit I am not going back to the command line, except maybe in some rare situations. I am happy they are making good use of those [VC investments](https://www.cnet.com/news/github-raises-100-million-from-andreessen-horowitz/).
