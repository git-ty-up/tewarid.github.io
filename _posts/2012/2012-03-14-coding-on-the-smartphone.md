Today I coded and tested code snippets on my iPhone in Mobile Safari using [ideone.com](http://ideone.com/). I am wondering if I should buy the CodeToGo [app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/codetogo/id382677229). I found typing certain keys like the curly brackets a royal pain. That app puts them prominently on the onscreen keyboard.

Getting a clean iTunes URL to link to is impossible with Google on mobile Safari. Doesn't Google provide clean (as in not redirecting from google.com) URLs any more? I had to use Bing.
