Apple [has won](http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/24/3266571/apple-decisively-wins-samsung-trial-what-it-means). Now what?

Both Apple and Samsung tried their best to show that the other's products were based (nay inspired) by past _innovations_. Apple was better at doing it. The Jury bought that. Samsung needs to do better homework the next time. That said, the newer breed of Galaxy smartphones are way distinct from their first predecessors and the market is [rewarding them](http://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2012/08/31/apple-losing-in-the-smart-phone-market-tries-to-win-in-court/) handsomely. So, I think Samsung can just settle and go on.

In the end, the market decides the winner, not the courts. Look at Java. Sun won. Java is everywhere. But where is Sun really? Apple is [protecting its turf](https://www.cultofmac.com/187014/why-apple-sues/). It's all about market and survival. Bickering on patents and techniques is one way the system allows you to protect your interests.

Peace.
