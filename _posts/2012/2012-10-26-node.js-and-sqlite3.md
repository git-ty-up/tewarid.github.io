Node.js and Sqlite3 can be used as a foundation for apps that are cross-platform, browser-based (leverage HTML5), and network-intensive. In this post I comment about some of the work required in building such a foundation.

### Install sqlite3 for Node.js on Windows

The installation procedure for the [sqlite3](https://github.com/developmentseed/node-sqlite3) module is slightly complex and requires that you have installed the [python](http://python.org/) interpreter and the [VC++ compiler](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-products). Then just head over to the command prompt and run:

```cmd
npm install sqlite3 --arch=ia32
```

You can add the -g option after npm if you want to install to the global node_modules folder. The arch option is [required](https://github.com/developmentseed/node-sqlite3/issues/99) for the module to work on Windows 7 64-bit. Without it you'll get a cryptic message like:

```text
Error: %1 is not a valid Win32 application
```

Hopefully, at [some point](https://github.com/developmentseed/node-sqlite3/issues/67) pre-compiled binaries will be provided for Windows.

### Opening or creating a database

I like to maintain a database creation script. The code below is a simple example of how I detect and execute the creation script.

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose();

fs.exists('database', function (exists) {
  db = new sqlite3.Database('database');

  if (!exists) {
    console.info('Creating database. This may take a while...');
    fs.readFile('create.sql', 'utf8', function (err, data) {
      if (err) throw err;
      db.exec(data, function (err) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.info('Done.');
      });
    });
  }
});
```

Here's how create.sql may look like:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customer (
  id INT NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT PK_customer PRIMARY KEY (id ASC)
);

CREATE TABLE sale (
  id INT NOT NULL,
  CONSTRAINT PK_sale PRIMARY KEY (id ASC)
);
```

### Embedding Node.js

It is rather convenient if you can package Node.js and its modules in a single installer. I discussed this in the post [Adding lots of source files to a WiX installer script]({% link _posts/2012/2012-10-19-adding-lots-of-source-files-to-a-wix-installer-script.md %}) recently. I use npm without the -g option to download and install all modules in a node_modules folder. I place the single executable version of Node.js in the same folder. The installer just needs to package that folder, and you have a Windows-specific package of Node.js and your application's module dependencies ready to install.
