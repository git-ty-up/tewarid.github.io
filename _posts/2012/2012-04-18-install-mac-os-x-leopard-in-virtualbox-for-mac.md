# Install Mac OS X Leopard in VirtualBox for Mac

Install VirtualBox version 4.1 for Mac. You'll need the original install media of Mac OS X Leopard. Create a new VM with guest OS as Mac OS X Server. Mount the DVD drive of the host as the DVD drive for your VM. Start the VM. You'll need to partition the virtual drive using the disk utility as a GUID Partition Table.
