# Run Node.js in a Docker container

In this post, I explore how to run a Node.js web application in a Docker container based on the [StrongLoop Process Manager](https://hub.docker.com/r/strongloop/strong-pm/) image. I also have a requirement to export and deploy the Docker container to a server that lacks internet access.

Create a new Node.js web app using express-example-app as the starting point

```bash
git clone https://github.com/strongloop/express-example-app.git
```

Head into the app folder and install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Start application using PM

```bash
slc start
```

Access http://localhost:3001 in a browser to ensure it works.

Shutdown PM

```bash
slc ctl shutdown
```

Create a new Docker container using StrongLoop PM image as the starting point

```bash
docker run --detach --restart=no --publish 8701:8701 --publish 3001:3001 --name strong-pm-container strongloop/strong-pm
```

Deploy example app by running following command in directory of app

```bash
slc deploy http://localhost:8701/ master
```

Access http://localhost:3001 in a browser to ensure it works.

Discover container's id

```bash
docker ps -a
```

Commit container to a new image

```bash
docker commit 653811fd29f3 myimage
```

Save image to tar file

```bash
docker save -o myimage.tar myimage
```

Load image file in a new Docker instance (on another machine)

```bash
docker load -i myimage.tar
```

Run image in a new container

```bash
docker run --detach --restart=no --publish 3001:3001 --name strong-pm-container myimage
```

Access http://localhost:3001 in a browser to ensure it works.
