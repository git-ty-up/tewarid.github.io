title: Tips for Portuguese speakers writing English

I have seen Portuguese speakers repeat the same mistakes very often when writing English. This post tries to document these mistakes with links to worthwhile references.

* ~~Different of~~ / Different from / Different than

    This mistake usually happens when you literally translate _diferente de_. _Different of_ is wrong, use [_different from_ or _different than_](http://www.englishforums.com/English/DifferentFromDifferentOf/grxml/post.htm).

* Once / Since

    This mistake usually happens when you literally translate _uma vez_ in a phrase. [If you mean](http://www.sk.com.br/forum/display_message.php?message_id=39050) _because_, use _since_. If you mean _after_, use _once_.

* ~~Must to~~ / Have to

    This mistake usually happens when you literally translate _tem que_ in a phrase. _Must to_ is incorrect, use _have to_ or just _must_.
