I use my laptop for work. I also use my iPad for work, but also for play. If my laptop is to remain my primary computing device, it needs the following as soon as possible.

* It has to be lighter
* It needs to transfer less heat to my lap, in spite of heavy use
* It has to have a screen with a resolution of 200 PPI or better
* It needs to have lots of physical memory, but be responsive when swapping to disk
* It needs to run all my Windows apps
* I need to be able to develop on Mac OS X and Linux, besides Windows

You may be reading this and saying, you can go out and buy a MacBook Pro with retina display. You will be right, a MacBook Pro has in fact [been declared](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57581290-37/macbook-pro-declared-best-performing-windows-laptop/) the best Windows laptop. Now, I so wish I could pay for that at Brazilian prices.
