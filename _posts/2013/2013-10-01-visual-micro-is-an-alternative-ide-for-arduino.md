For those doing any kind of Arduino programming, and searching for a better IDE, Visual Micro is the answer. It is a Visual Studio plugin that makes coding Arduino sketches much easier. Visual Studio has always had an excellent code editor for C/C++, but it is pricey and requires you to be a Windows user. If you're interested, [download](http://www.visualmicro.com/page/Arduino-Visual-Studio-Downloads.aspx) and [test](http://www.visualmicro.com/post/2011/10/04/How-to-test-a-new-installation-of-Arduino-for-Visual-Studio.aspx) the Visual Micro plugin. If you don't own Visual Studio, the plugin also [works](http://www.visualmicro.com/page/Arduino-for-Atmel-Studio.aspx) with the **free** Atmel Studio 6.1 IDE.
