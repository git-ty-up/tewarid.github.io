The 15 inch MackBook Pro with Retina display is the best laptop I have used. Here's what I like about it

* Mac OS X
* Beautiful 15 inch (220 pixel-per-inch) Retina display that allows you to read a PDF file two (side-by-side) pages at a time
* Parallels Desktop 8, and the ability to run Windows 8 seamlessly, and Linux
* The ability to build Android for a target device in 40 minutes
* The ability to run several virtual machines and not feel it

I have one gripe - the battery doesn't last as much as an iPad's. Apple should be able to deliver better battery life in the next hardware and software refresh, with Intel fourth generation Haswell processors and MacOS Mavericks.
