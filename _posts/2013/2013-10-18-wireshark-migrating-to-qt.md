Wireshark on Mac OS X is downright ugly. It requires XQuartz, an X11 port for OS X. Wireshark have [announced](https://blog.wireshark.org/2013/10/switching-to-qt/) that they have begun a steady migration to Qt. The move has its critics, and backers. I back whatever looks better than it currently does. As Miguel de Icaza of Xamarin points out, it is possible to [look good](http://tirania.org/s/138c98b8.png) on Mac OS X with the Gtk+ port for Cocoa. So what gives?
