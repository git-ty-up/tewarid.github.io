### Some observations

Adobe Reader supports the most features. If it had EPUB format support it would be unbeatable.

Documents by Readdle has the best cloud integration. It is an indispensable app to have if you store your books in the cloud. Its reading features lack polish. Night view is low contrast, making reading very difficult. EPUB support is buggy. It does support other media formats besides books.

Readdle is another competent reading app. It is very polished and has one feature that no other app has so far. It tracks your reading time, and tells you how much time you have left to finish the book. The only significant feature missing is search.

### Portability

If you have an Android device and want cross-platform support, Adobe Reader seems to be the best option, but PDF books are unwieldy on small screens.

Kindle is my favorite for reading on small screens. I read most novels on a smartphone. I wish the app had better PDF support - search, copy text to clipboard, highlights and notes, and night view.

At the end of the day, I wish all books were DRM-free and I could read them in the best app du jour.
