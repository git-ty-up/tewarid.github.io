# Tunnelblick OpenVPN client

If you need a decent OpenVPN client on a Mac, [Tunnelblick](https://tunnelblick.net/) is an excellent choice. Importing the OpenVPN client configuration file (.ovpn extension) is slightly more contrived than it should be, but if you follow the steps shown by Tunnelblick you should be good to go in no time.
