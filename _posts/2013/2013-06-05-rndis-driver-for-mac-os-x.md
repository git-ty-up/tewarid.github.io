There's finally an RNDIS driver for Mac OS X called [HoRNDIS](http://joshuawise.com/horndis). All those gadgets that use RNDIS over USB with Windows and Linux, should now also work with Mac OS X. That includes Android smartphones that allow tethering, Windows Mobile devices, MOTOTRBO radios, and so on. Fortunately for us, it is open source (GPL) and available at [GitHub](https://github.com/jwise/horndis).
