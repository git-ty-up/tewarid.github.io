# Android Studio

I have been an admirer of IntelliJ IDEA, but used mostly Eclipse and Netbeans. Google announced the early access preview of Android Studio around Google I/O, and it is evolving quickly. I have to say I am blown away by how good it is. It is [based](http://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2013/05/15/intellij-idea-is-the-base-for-android-studio-the-new-ide-for-android-developers/) on the Community Edition of IntelliJ IDEA, an [open source](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community) project.

I have found it extremely easy to migrate from Eclipse ADT to Android Studio. I'll not repeat what is already well documented at [Migrating from Eclipse](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/migrate.html). The interface designer is nice and stable. Developers used to Visual Studio and Xcode have one less reason to fret Android development.
