# Windows-1252 charset codes

The following are some [Windows-1252](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252) (ISO 8859-1) charset codes I've seen in legacy HTML documents created in Word. The replacement suggestions are for conversion to UTF-8 characters available on the keyboard. Alternatively, you may want to use HTML [character entities](https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref).

`\x85` (ellipsis …) replace with three dots ...

`\x91` (curved quote ‘) replace with normal quote '

`\x92` (curved quote ’) replace with normal quote '

`\x94` (curved quote ”) replace with normal quote "
