I purchased the Stieg Larsson thriller [The Girl Who Played with Fire](http://www.amazon.com/Girl-Who-Played-Fire-ebook/dp/B001NLKT60) on February 12th for $5.00. Now it is on sale for $7.99, a noticeable price appreciation. Is it the effect of Random House books [appearing](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2381265,00.asp) in the iBooks store? In my opinion, e-Books should be cheaper. They are cheaper to replicate and distribute. They cannot be easily shared with anyone else, which in theory should lead to more individual purchases.
