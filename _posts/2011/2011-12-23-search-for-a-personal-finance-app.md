These are just some features I look for in a personal finance app

* Backup
* Split transactions
* Define own categories
* Reports and charts based on categories
* Budget based on categories
* Recurring transactions or reminders
* Multiple currencies

I am moving from a life tethered to a PC to a life tethered to a Smartphone. In that spirit I was in search for an iOS app that had most of the above. I think I may have found it in the form of [PocketMoney](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocketmoney-checkbook-budgets/id283494170?mt=8). I have tried their Lite version and things look good.

I do wish the app had a report or view to show missing checks. A workaround is to filter based on the transaction ID and look for any missing check #.

In the past, I have used Excel, [JGnash](https://ccavanaugh.github.io/jgnash/), and then [MoneyDance](http://www.moneydance.com/). MoneyDance will not allow me to go Smartphone only. Their desktop app has recently been updated and I'll have to pay to get the latest version.
