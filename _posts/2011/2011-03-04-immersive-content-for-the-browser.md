# Immersive content for the Browser

Second life is probably the best example of a 3D simulated universe, a highly immersive experience.

I've seen experiments in rendering 3D using Javascript. The HTML 5 Canvas element is at the center of that revolution. Check [CanvasMOL](http://alteredqualia.com/canvasmol/) as one example of what is possible. Chrome and other webkit-based browsers have been working on GPU-based acceleration of the HTML 5 Canvas and the associated WebGL 3D graphics API. Check this cool [demo](https://www.webkit.org/blog-files/webgl/SpiritBox.html) of WebGL in action. Browser-based games that use these features are beginning to appear. Imagine racing cars such as rendered by [HelloRacer](http://helloracer.com/webgl/).

Adobe Flash is used by pretty much everyone in the 2D gaming community. Check out [Club Penguin](http://www.clubpenguin.com/) and [Habbo](http://www.habbo.com/) as examples of this approach. [Unity 3D](http://unity3d.com/gallery/game-list/) is also available for doing Browser-based games in Java for the web, and also for a raft of different devices.

All in all, developers love it when they can target different devices and form-factors from the same code base, without worrying about obsolescence. HTML 5 may really shine there.
