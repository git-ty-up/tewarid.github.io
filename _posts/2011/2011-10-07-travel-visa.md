How much bureaucracy can there be in getting a travel visa you ask? Here's a list of requirements to apply for a Schengen visa at the Spanish consulate, so you get a feel for how much our countries mire us in endless paperwork.

* Schengen visa form
* 2, 3x4 photos
* Bank statement for the last 4 months
* Salary receipts for the last 4 months
* Copy of home ownership contract
* Copy of IT statement
* Copy of country ID
* Copy of country of residence ID
* Confirmed travel tickets
* Confirmed hotel reservation
* Invitation letters
* Letter from company, with signature verified/authenticated
* Travel insurance
* Payment receipt for travel insurance
* Copy of all the pages of the passport
* Passport
* Visa fees - BRL 160.75 or about USD 92 or 67 Euros

All that for a visa that will last exactly eleven days - the duration of my trip.
