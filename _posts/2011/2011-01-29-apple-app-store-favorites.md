I didn't imagine I would find a device to be so much fun. An Apple iPod Touch 4 I bought last year has turned into one of my favorite time wasters, and my daughters love it too. It is also a wonderful productivity tool. My old Windows Mobile smartphone has seen its usage plummet, except occasionally as a GPS map, or for tethering my PC to the Web.

I have listed some of my favorite Game and non-Game apps below. It is hard to place them in any particular order, so I have just ordered them alphabetically. I have also mentioned the price I purchased the app for, if it wasn't free.

### Games

* [Angry Birds](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/angry-birds/id343200656) (99c)

    This game is at the first position of the Top 25 list for several months now, it deserves its ranking.

* [Cat Physics](https://itunes.apple.com/se/app/cat-physics/id373342398)

    This a recent one for me, I grabbed it for its price (free) but already like it a lot.

* [Cover Orange](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cover-orange/id405229260)

    This is another favorite of mine and of my daughters.

* [Cut the Rope](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cut-the-rope/id380293530) (99c)

    My daughters love this one.

* [Fruit Ninja](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fruit-ninja/id362949845) (99c)

    I don't find myself playing it much, but it is so good that I had to buy it. I am crazy for fruits and it makes my mouth water.

* [PES 2010](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/pes-2010-pro-evolution-soccer/id376797399) (99c)

    I am not much of a football fan, my elder daughter is. I bought this game during the holidays for its price, but it keeps my daughter entertained, that makes it good enough for me.

* [Pocket Frogs](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-frogs/id386644958)

    I have to admit, I am addicted to this game, it is my topmost time wasters. I am at only 13% of the achievements, which means I will be wasting quite a lot of my time over this one.

* [Talking Tomcat](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/talking-tom-cat/id377194688)

    This one is a favorite with my younger daughter. She loves poking the cat, talking or laughing at it, hear it repeat all of it back at her, you get the idea...

### Non-Games

* [Documents To Go](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/documents-to-go-office-suite/id317117961) (9.99)

    A convenient tool to view and (sparingly) edit documents, spreadsheets and presentations (Premium edition only) . I have not been able to project presentations using a dock connector to VGA adapter.

* [Dropbox](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dropbox/id327630330)

    Makes it a breeze to get files into and out of the device. Requires an internet connection though.

* [Facebook](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/facebook/id284882215)

    Social networks are quietly taking over from other means of communications, particularly email. Facebook is leading the charge and this app is a must have.

* [Free Graphing Calculator](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/free-graphing-calculator/id378009553)

    Free graphing calculator for the Math buff. It has a full-features scientific calculator, 2D graphing functionality, a reference section with math formulas, and some other niceties tucked away, such as a triangle solver and a polynomial solver.

* [Gyroscope](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/gyroscope/id381953722)

    Helps to get things nicely aligned, like a square ceiling light fixture aligned to the walls around it.

* [iBooks](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ibooks/id364709193)

    Book reader with PDF viewing support.

* [iHandy Level](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/ihandy-level/id299852753)

    If you do any kind of work around the house that requires a perfectly horizontal or vertical surface, and you don't have a level, this is a decent replacement.

* [KAYAK](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kayak-flight-hotel-search/id305204535)

    Forward your flight and hotel booking confirmation to trips@kayak.com and a trip is created, all information is conveniently synced to the app on the device.

* [Keeper](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/keeper-password-data-vault/id287170072)

    A place to store those pesky passwords and PIN codes.

* [Kindle](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kindle/id302584613)

    Read your Kindle books on the device. Nothing fancy, just as it should be.

* [Merriam Webster](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/merriam-webster-dictionary/id399452287)

    Nice free dictionary. You need to be online to use some features such as voice search and audio pronunciation.

* [Network Ping Lite](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/network-ping-lite/id289967115)

    For the geek. It also has a simple telnet console.

* [Pulse](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pulse-news-mini/id377594176)

    News reader. Makes sharing to Facebook a breeze.

* [Skype](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skype/id304878510)

    It was good for voice, now it also does video.

* [Soundhound](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/soundhound/id355554941)

    Listens to a song and identifies it for you.

* [wunderlist](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wunderlist-task-manager/id406644151)

    iCal does not have task lists, this app fits the bill.
