title: The God Dependency
tags: god
---

I have a God dependency. It appears when I am going through trying times, a turbulent flight for instance. It mostly leads me to happiness, on rare occassions it leads me to sadness, and sometimes to guilt. For some, it can be obsessive in nature, to the point of making them slave to it, making them want to depend on the will of God for everything.

What is God?

I envision God as infinity - a point beyond which my imagination ~~cannot~~ does not want to seek, a point that is the ground zero of my neural network, a moral North star. I see God as the limitless expanse of the universe, a void filled with energy that coalesces into matter that forms life. Life that is conscious of itself, and capable of contemplating everything and nothing, infinity and void.
