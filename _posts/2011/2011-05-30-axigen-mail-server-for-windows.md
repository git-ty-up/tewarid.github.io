title: Axigen mail server for Windows

I was looking for a mail server for Windows with IMAP v4 support. I came across and installed [Axigen](https://www.axigen.com/mail-server/free/) - they also have a version for Linux. The free version allows 100 accounts, good enough for my needs. They require you to register, and send a license key that is good for a year. The setup was painless. The admin interface is browser based. Setting up IMAP with SSL was straightforward. I needed SSL to use plain authentication using the login command of IMAP.
