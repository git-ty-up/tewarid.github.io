netcat is a wonderful utility for those who regularly do network programming. I find myself using netcat to avoid writing code to do simple network IO. Here I document some of the common uses I put it to. A similar replacement utility called [ncat](https://nmap.org/ncat/) is available with [nmap](https://nmap.org/), it also works on Windows. The version of netcat used in the examples below is the OpenBSD version distributed by Ubuntu.

### Send or Receive data using UDP

```bash
netcat -u 127.0.0.1 8001
```

Any data you type into `stdin` is sent to port `8001` of the `localhost`. You can start another instance of netcat with the command line shown below to receive the data.

```bash
netcat -l -u 127.0.0.1 8001
```

This can be used to establish a simple UDP based chat mechanism.

### Send or Receive data using TCP

The UDP chat example in the previous section can be implemented in TCP by dropping the `-u` argument from the arguments. TCP is the default mode. This being TCP, the receiver end has to be started first (the server) and then the sender (the client).
