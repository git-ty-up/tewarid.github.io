# HP sells Visual Collaboration business; Google announces WebRTC

In two unrelated events, HP has [sold](http://www.polycom.com/company/news_room/press_releases/2011/20110601-3.html) its Visual Collaboration business to Polycom, and Google has announced the [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) initiative. Polycom has also announced an industry wide initiative called [The Open Visual Communications Consortium](http://www.polycom.com/company/industry_affiliations/ovcc/index.html), whereas the approach that Google is taking is to support synergistic initiatives from the [W3C](http://www.w3.org/2011/04/webrtc-charter.html), [IETF](http://tools.ietf.org/wg/rtcweb/charters) and the WHATWG. Google also released IP they acquired from [Global IP Solutions](http://www.gipscorp.com/) under an [open project](https://webrtc.googlesource.com/src).
