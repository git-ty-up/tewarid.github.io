My elder daugther has just begun fourth grade. I reproduce below the expenses incurred on textbooks in Brazil. I have recorded prices based on the following exchange rates

* 1 USD = 1.7 BRL (Brazilian Real)

* 1 USD = 46 INR (Indian Rupee)

This is how much each text book cost me. You can usually wring a ten percent discount if you pay in cash or using a debit card. I paid using a credit card.

* Math - USD 49

* Science - USD 47

* History - USD 32

* Geography - USD 44

* Portuguese - USD 47

* English - USD 44

The schools usually ask the parents to buy story books that can cost an additional USD 120. Notebooks and other supporting material can cost another USD 150. That takes the total cost of books per year for a fourth grader to USD 530. For the sake of comparison that is about INR 24,380 or about BRL 900.

How much have you spent on school textbooks this year?
