# iOS Tips and Tricks

Inspired by the article at [Techcrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2011/12/26/ios-tips-and-tricks-iphone-ipad/) here are some more tips:

* Four fingers drag up (iPad) - brings up the app switcher.

* Five finger pinch (iPad) - shows the home screen.

* Go to Settings, select General, then select Accessibility; turn Assistive Touch on, and it will add a floating home button to your screen.

* In the keyboard, touch and hold a key to bring up special characters associated with that key

* Moving icons around and want to exit the squiggly icons mode without using the home button? Pull down the notification center.
