# Inquire Bluetooth service record on Windows

Linux distros have excellent built-in support for inquiring characteristics of Bluetooth devices around you, using hcitool and sdptool. The closest thing on Windows is the [Bluetooth Inquiry Record Verifier](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/drivers/devtest/bluetooth-inquiry-record-verifier) tool (sdpverify.exe) that ships with [Windows Driver Kit](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/windows-driver-kit) (WDK). Beware, WDK is a rather large download.
