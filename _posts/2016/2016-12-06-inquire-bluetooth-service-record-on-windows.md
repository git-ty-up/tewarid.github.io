# Inquire Bluetooth service record on Windows

Linux distros have excellent built-in support for inquiring characteristics of Bluetooth devices around you, using hcitool and sdptool. The closest thing on Windows is the [Bluetooth Inquiry Record Verifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/bluetooth-inquiry-record-verifier) tool (`sdpverify.exe`) that ships with [Windows Driver Kit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk) (WDK). Beware, WDK is a rather large download.
